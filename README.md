# An-Assistive-System
It is an assistive multi-mode system designed to support individuals with visual, hearing, and speech impairments. It provides three functional modes: Blind Mode – obstacle detection using camera input and voice alerts. Deaf Mode – sound recognition (e.g., horn, siren, help) with on-screen warnings. Mute Mode – text-to-speech functionality that allows users to communicate verbally through typed text. It provides accessibility features that improve independence, safety, and communication for people with disabilities. Instead of separate tools for each requirement, it integrates all three assistive functions in a unified interface, making the solution more practical, affordable, and user-friendly.
