#### System Architecture:



* User selects one of the three modes
* Depending on mode:

&nbsp;	> Blind mode → Camera detects obstacles → Voice output

&nbsp;	> Deaf mode → Microphone detects audio triggers → GUI alert

&nbsp;	> Mute mode → User types text → System generates speech

* GUI/Web interface displays \& communicates outputs
* User can stop mode anytime using Stop button
